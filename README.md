# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

##  Overview

This project aims to predict the selling price of old cars using Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features such as car brand, year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission type, mileage, and more. The objective is to provide an accurate estimation of a car's price based on historical data.

##  Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and selection

Model training using various regression techniques

Model evaluation 


##  Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)

Jupyter Notebook

##  Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing contains various car attributes such as:

Car name

Manufacturing year

Selling price

Present price

Kilometers driven

Fuel type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)

Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)

Owner history

##  Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling and normalization

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

##  Model Training

Implemented and compared different regression models:

Linear Regression Model
Lasso Regression Model

##  Model Evaluation

R-squared Score (RÂ²)

## Results & Insights

Both Linear regression model and lasso regression model provided the best accuracy.

The selling price of a car is significantly influenced by the year of manufacture, fuel type, and transmission type.
